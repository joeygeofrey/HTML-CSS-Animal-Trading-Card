# HTML-CSS-Animal-Trading-Card

In this project I am deploying <b>HTML and CSS</b> to create a virtual animal trading card.

The user may interact with the card by hovering over the individual cards.

## Running the Animal Trading Card

To run this program, please open `card.html` in a supported browser.
